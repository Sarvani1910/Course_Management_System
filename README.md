To run the application, you need to install the necessary dependencies for both the frontend and backend. First, navigate to the frontend directory using the command cd frontend. 
Then, install the required modules by running npm install, which includes nodemodules, react-thunk, redux, react-redux, axios, and react-router-dom. 
Once the installation is complete, start the frontend server with npm start. 
Next, navigate to the backend directory using the command cd ../backend and start the backend server by running npm start. 
This will set up both the frontend and backend servers for the application.
